# cultural-social-data-analysis
### Hi there! Welcome to my final group project for the Applications of Cultural and Social Data Analysis course from my master's program. The project is the culmination of two courses stretching over an entire semester.
Using python and the pandas library in python our group cleaned, transformed and merged datasets related to countries' covid policy stringency and their happiness. The original datasets are included in this file as the tables beginning with the word Policy and the one called
DataForTable...

The cleaned and transformed versions of the datasets, where extraneous columns and rows were dropped and means or medians calculated, are also included in this file. They contain the words "cleaned" or "final", in some way or another. We finally merged the datasets together.
This is clearly demarcated in a file name, too. Additionally, I have made available the jupiter notebook file which shows our entire code should you want to follow along.

Check out the culmination of our work, too! We used tableau to build data visualizations that were eventually embedded in a google site. They are dynamic and adjustable for your convenience. https://sites.google.com/view/covid19happiness/home?authuser=0
